The dataset contains following four input features computed from
400X400 images of bank notes:
1. variance of Wavelet Transformed image (continuous)
2. skewness of Wavelet Transformed image (continuous)
3. Curtosis of Wavelet Transformed image (continuous)
4. entropy of image (continuous)
Each instance is labelled as fake (label 0) or authentic (label1).
For the given dataset, implement Decision Tree-based CART algorithm:
(i) Step-by-Step
(ii) Inbuilt Function
