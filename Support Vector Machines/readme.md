Step 1: Load the dataset.

Step2: Map the output values to 1 for positive class and -1 for negative class.

Step 3: Divide the dataset into input and output features. Scale the input features and add a column of oneâ€™s in input features. Divide the dataset into train and test split.

Step 4: Code a function to compute cost gradient given a weight matrix, and a particular input and output training example (as in Stochastic Gradient descent (SGD)) we consider
only one training example.

Step 5: Run Stochastic Gradient Algorithm for updating weights in number of iterations and given learning rate.

Step 6: Predict the value of output variable for test set predicted according to sign of w.x

Step 7: Performance Evaluation
